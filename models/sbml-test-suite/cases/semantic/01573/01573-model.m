 The model has an assigned stoichiometry for a boundary species, using stoichiometry math.

The model contains:
* 2 species (S1, S2)
* 1 compartment (C)
* 1 species reference (S1_stoich)

There is one reaction:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| J0: S1_stoich S1 -> S2 | $S1 * 0.1$ |]
Note:  the following stoichiometries are set separately:  S1_stoich

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial concentration of species S1 | $3$ | variable |
| Initial concentration of species S2 | $3$ | variable |
| Initial volume of compartment 'C' | $1$ | constant |
| Initial value of species reference 'S1_stoich' | $2$ | variable |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
