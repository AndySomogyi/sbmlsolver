/**
 * The RoadRunner configuration system allows a collection of potentially
 * disparate objects to have all of thier configuration parameters collected
 * and assembled into a single xml document.
 *
 * The hierarchy of Configurable maintians no additional state other than the
 * local configuration parameters of each terminal node and the parent - child
 * relationships. The xml document / nodes exists only for the lifetime of the
 * createConfigNode / loadConfig calls. No xml objects should ever be maintined
 * outside these method calls.
 *
 * There are two method in the Configurable interface, one returns a configuration
 * as an xml node the other allows the object to load or read its configuration
 * from an xml document.
 *
 * Classes that implment this interface must return either a capabilities,
 * capability or parameter node. The static addChild function will automatically
 * determine what type the child and parents are and add it in the appropriate
 * location. So for example, say the both the parent and child nodes are
 * 'cababities', in this case, the list of 'cabability' elements is pulled
 * from the child and appended to the parent's capabitiles node as child
 * nodes. This situation is encountered when a PluginManager is used. RoadRunner
 * does not require nor is even aware of a PluginManager. RoadRunner considers
 * itself a top level object thus returns a 'capabilities' node. The PluginManager
 * contains a RoadRunner object, so when the PluginManager creates a 'cababilities'
 * node, asks all of its plugins for a config, these are typically a 'cabability'
 * which are added to the 'cababities' node that the PluginManager created. The
 * PluginManager also asks RoadRunner for its capabilities, so in this case,
 * RoadRunner's set of cabability nodes are automatically appended to the PluginManager's
 * cababity nodes and a single combined document is returned.
 *
 * Configurable is designed as a pure interface, one should NEVER create or delete
 * a Configurable object directy.
 *
 * This being said, there are a number of STATIC methods on this class to perform
 * various configurable activities. As these are static, the do not affect the binary
 * layout of this interface. They could also have been declared as pure functions, but
 * were put here to make it clear that they perform Configurable activities.
