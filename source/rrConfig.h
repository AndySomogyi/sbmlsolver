/**
 * read or store default values.
 *
 * Many of RoadRunner classes use a number of configration parameters. Most of these can be set
 * using the Config class. The values stored in the Config class only determine the defaut values of
 * parameters.
 *
 * The Config class will look in the following locations for the config file, and will load the
 * values from the first config file it finds. If it does not find a config file in one of the
 * following locations, a default set of configuration parameters are used. The search locations of
 * the config file are:
 *
 * #1: the ROADRUNNER_CONFIG environment variable
 *
 * #2: try the user's home directory for roadrunner.conf, i.e.:
 *
 * /Users/andy/roadrunner.conf
 *
 * #3: try the user's home directory for .roadrunner.conf, i.e.:
 *
 * /Users/andy/.roadrunner.conf
 *
 * #4: try the same directory as the roadrunner shared library, this
 * will be the same directory as the python _roadrunner.pyd python extension module, i.e.:
 *
 * /Users/andy/local/lib/roadrunner.conf
 *
 * #5: try one directory up from the where the shared library or program is at, i.e.:
 *
 * /Users/andy/local/roadrunner.conf
 *
 * The conf file is just a plain text file of where each line may
 * be key / value pair separated by a â":", i.e.
 *
 * KEY_NAME : Value Any line that does not match this format is ignored, and keys that are not found
 * are also ignored. Therefore, any line that does not start w* ith a word character is considered a
 * comment.
 *
 * All of the configuration managment functions are static method of the Config class, and all of
 * the configuration keys are static attributes * of the Config class, these are documented in the
 * Configuration Functions section.
 *
 * As all of the Config class methods are static, one never instantiates the Config class.
