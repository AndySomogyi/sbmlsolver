/**
 * All LLVM code generating objects basically need at a minimum three things
 * to operate:
 *
 * 1: sbml Model - what to process
 * 2: llvm Context - all llvm functions need this, manages llvm memory
 * 3: llvm Module - where the generated code will go
 *
 *
 * Code generators also need to know the symbols that are in the sbml doc.
 * These *could* be re-determined in each code gen, but wastefull. The
 * symbols can be thought of as the first pass of the compiler, so all symbols
 * are determined ahead of time before any code generation.
 *
 * They also make use of an llvm IRBuilder, one of these *could* be allocated
 * in each code gen object, but that would be wastefull, so we use a single one
 * per sbml compilation, and each code gen just resets the builder insert point,
 * that is what is was designed to do.
 *
 * So, that leaves us with 5 object that are needed by code generators.
 * Should all code gens have all 5 args passed to thier ctors? There is much
 * talk about how context objects are evil, however this one is NOT inteneded to
 * grow, only store the absolute minimun information that all code generators
 * need.
 *
 * This class basically functions as a set of ivars if all code generators
 * were methods on a single code gen class.
 *
 * TODO doc wise discuss the problems with context objects, and why this one
 * address all the concerns.
 *
 * TODO document memory managment, engine owns model, ...
