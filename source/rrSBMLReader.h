 * Read an sbml document from either disk, a remote url, or as a string.

 * This function will first try to iterperet the string as uri, if that
 * fails, it will try as a local file path, and finally if that fails, it will
 * treat the string as whole sbml document and return the string.
 *
 * This is simple enough that it should belong in RoadRunner proper, however we currently
 * use Poco for reading http streams, and it seems to compilation issues if "windows.h"
 * is included before, an evidently some other roadrunner file includes windows.h,
 * so we put all of this here by itself we we can make sure that there is no
 * nasty windows files included.
 *
 * also, we put it as a static class method because libSBML already uses 'readSBML'
 * and we want to avoid namespace collisions.
