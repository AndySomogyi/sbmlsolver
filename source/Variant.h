/**
 * A basic type to hold a variety of data types.
 *
 * Unfourtunatly C++ does not have a standard variant type so we have to
 * create one here.
 *
 * This is a fairly low performance class and is intended soley for
 * infrequent operations such as setting configuration parameters.
 *
 * If Python support is enabled, this class can convert to and from a
 * Python object.
 *
 * Rationale:
 * C++ does not have a built in variant type. Other variant types exist
 * such as boost::any and Poco dynamic var. However including the one of these
 * as part of our public API would forever tie us to that particular library, and
 * would impose yet another dependency.
 *
 * Only very basic variant type support is needed and this class exposes the
 * absolute minimum possible API to support such features, and provides
 * just two methods of getting and storing native C++ types in it.
 *
 * This is *currently* implemented by Poco but the implementation is fully
 * opaque and may change in the future.
