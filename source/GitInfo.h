 * A file that is pre-processed by cmake to generate a GitInfo.h.
 * The generated file is intended to be include only in VersionInfo.cpp
 * as a way to get info about what git branch we are on. 
 * 
 * this has a few static (so they only show up in the current compilation unit)
 * function get return info about the git branch and last commit.
