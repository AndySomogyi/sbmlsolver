==== DOCUMENTATION FOR Roadrunner_build shell script =====


INTRODUCTION

This shell script downloads, configures, and builds libRoadrunner, starting from an empty directory. It should work correctly on Mac, Windows, and Linux. However, note that it is designed for developers, not for end users, so some aspects of it might require modification for your own system.


INSTRUCTIONS

(1) Your computer needs to have CMake and Git installed. It also needs XCode, Visual Studio, or some other appropriate compiler.

(2) Open a bash shell (zsh is probably fine, too). On Macs, this means opening a Terminal window. On Windows, you cannot use "Command Prompt"; instead, look in the Start Menu, and under Git should be a "Git Bash" option, which works well.

(2) Navigate to the directory where this shell script is stored. Create an empty directory for the build and navigate to that one. This new directory is called <root> here.

(3) Enter: "../Roadrunner_build" to run the shell script. It should just run by itself without issues. It may take several hours to run fully.


CODE DOCUMENTATION

The script code is divided into five parts.

Part 1 detects whether your system is Windows or non-Windows. On my Windows computer and in a bash shell, entering "echo $(uname)" returns "MINGW_NT-10.0-18363", so the script assumes that all Windows systems return a string that starts with "MINGW". The standard "make" and "make install" statements don't work on Windows, so this part of the script defines aliases for these statements. On Windows, the aliases are the MSBuild.exe executable followed by either all solution files for the "make" statement or by the "INSTALL.vcxproj" file for the "make install" statement.

Part 2 creates the necessary directory structure, all within the <root> directory.

Part 3 downloads, configures, builds, and installs LLVM. Installation is to <root>/install/llvm.

Part 4 downloads, configures, builds, and installs libroadrunner-deps. Installation is to <root>/install/roadrunner. For some reason, Windows computers require an extra CMake option, so it's listed there.

Part 5 downloads, configures, builds, and installs roadrunner. Installation is also to <root>/install/roadrunner.
