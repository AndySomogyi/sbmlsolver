Parallel RoadRunner
===================

For these simulations we use a simple model that we can access easily from one of RoadRunners
test suites. Its called ``BatchImmigrationDeath03`` and is model number ``00039`` from the
stochastic sbml test suite.

In each of the following sections we use RoadRunner to generate 1e6 stochastic simulations.

Serial code
------------
Performing the simulations in serial gives us a way to measure the performance enhancements
of using parallel code.

.. literalinclude:: gillespie_simulations_serial.py
    :linenos:
    :language: python


Multiprocessing library
------------------------

The simplest way in Python to use multiple cores simultaneously for running RoadRunner simulations
is to use the `multiprocessing <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html>`_ library.
Further, the simplest multiprocessing tool that one can use is a `multiprocessing.Pool`. This leads
to about a x3 speed up for this example.

.. literalinclude:: gillespie_simulations_multiprocessing_pool.py
    :linenos:
    :language: python


Ray library
