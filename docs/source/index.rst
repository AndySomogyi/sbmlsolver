libRoadRunner Overview
======================

This guide is intended as an introduction and reference of the RoadRunner
SBML Simulation Engine. This guide will show the most important features 
and provides a complete API reference. 


To get you started here is a very simple script that will load an example SBML model and run a time course
simulation and plot the results::

   import roadrunner

   # load an SBML model
   rr = roadrunner.RoadRunner("mymodel.xml")

   # simulate from 0 to 10 time units with 100 output rows
   result = rr.simulate(0,10,100)

   rr.plot()


Looking for a model to start with? We included a couple with libRoadRunner, see :ref:`loading-models`.   

.. note:: The result is a standard numpy array which may be used with any numpy or scipy functions
          or may be plotted using `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ 
          directly. See :ref:`plotting-data` for help in plotting. 

Now read the tutorials to learn more about the capabilities of RoadRunner.
