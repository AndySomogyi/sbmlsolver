Quickstart
==========

To get you started here is a very simple script that will load an example SBML model and run a time course
simulation and plot the results.

.. code-block:: python

   import roadrunner

   # load an SBML model
   rr = roadrunner.RoadRunner("mymodel.xml")

   # simulate from 0 to 10 time units with 100 output rows
   result = rr.simulate(0,10,100)

   rr.plot()


Looking for a model to start with? We included a couple with libRoadRunner, see :ref:`loading-models`.
