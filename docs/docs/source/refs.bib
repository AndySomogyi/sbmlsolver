    abstract = "{Life science researchers use computational models to articulate and test hypotheses about the behavior of biological systems. Semantic annotation is a critical component for enhancing the interoperability and reusability of such models as well as for the integration of the data needed for model parameterization and validation. Encoded as machine-readable links to knowledge resource terms, semantic annotations describe the computational or biological meaning of what models and data represent. These annotations help researchers find and repurpose models, accelerate model composition and enable knowledge integration across model repositories and experimental data stores. However, realizing the potential benefits of semantic annotation requires the development of model annotation standards that adhere to a community-based annotation protocol. Without such standards, tool developers must account for a variety of annotation formats and approaches, a situation that can become prohibitively cumbersome and which can defeat the purpose of linking model elements to controlled knowledge resource terms. Currently, no consensus protocol for semantic annotation exists among the larger biological modeling community. Here, we report on the landscape of current annotation practices among the COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork community and provide a set of recommendations for building a consensus approach to semantic annotation.}",

    abstract = "{As the number and complexity of biosimulation models grows, so do demands for tools that can help users understand models and compose more comprehensive and accurate systems from existing models. SemGen is a tool for semantics-based annotation and composition of biosimulation models designed to address this demand. A key SemGen capability is to decompose and then integrate models across existing model exchange formats including SBML and CellML. To support this capability, we use semantic annotations to explicitly capture the underlying biological and physical meanings of the entities and processes that are modeled. SemGen leverages annotations to expose a model’s biological and computational architecture and to help automate model composition.SemGen is freely available at https://github.com/SemBioProcess/SemGen.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

  title={Minimum information requested in the annotation of biochemical models (MIRIAM)},
  journal={Nature Biotechnology},

  volume={23},
  number={12},
  pages={1509-1515},
  abstract={Most of the published quantitative models in biology are lost for the community because they are either not made available or they are insufficiently characterized to allow them to be reused. The lack of a standard description format, lack of stringent reviewing and authors' carelessness are the main causes for incomplete model descriptions. With today's increased interest in detailed biochemical models, it is necessary to define a minimum quality standard for the encoding of those models. We propose a set of rules for curating quantitative models of biological systems. These rules define procedures for encoding and annotating models represented in machine-readable form. We believe their application will enable users to (i) have confidence that curated models are an accurate reflection of their associated reference descriptions, (ii) search collections of curated models with precision, (iii) quickly identify the biological phenomena that a given curated model or model constituent represents and (iv) facilitate model reuse and composition into large subcellular models.},
