\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Read an sbml document from either disk, a remote url, or as a std\+::string. 

This function will first try to iterperet the std\+::string as uri, if that fails, it will try as a local file path, and finally if that fails, it will treat the std\+::string as whole sbml document and return the std\+::string.

This is simple enough that it should belong in \mbox{\hyperlink{classrr_1_1RoadRunner}{Road\+Runner}} proper, however we currently use Poco for reading http streams, and it seems to compilation issues if \char`\"{}windows.\+h\char`\"{} is included before, an evidently some other roadrunner file includes windows.\+h, so we put all of this here by itself we we can make sure that there is no nasty windows files included.

also, we put it as a static class method because lib\+SBML already uses \textquotesingle{}read\+SBML\textquotesingle{} and we want to avoid namespace collisions.

performs some basic checks to see if the std\+::string is an sbml std\+::string. 

This just checks the basic format and checks on characters that are not valid file path characters. So if this std\+::string matches this function, there should basically be no way that this is a valid path or uri. \mbox{\Hypertarget{classrr_1_1SBMLReader_a44068da2706c5ee19f091b5c81def54c}\label{classrr_1_1SBMLReader_a44068da2706c5ee19f091b5c81def54c}}

read an SBML document from a local file path, a remote URI, or directlly from a sbml std\+::string. 

If the document is a local file, and has the comp extension, it is automatically flattened before begin returned.

If the std\+::string is already a SBML std\+::string, it is passed through. If the std\+::string is a local file or URI, the document is read from the source and the contents returned (and flattened if comp).
