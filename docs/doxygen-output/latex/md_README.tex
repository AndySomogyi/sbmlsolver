lib\+Road\+Runner is a high-\/performance and portable simulation engine for systems and synthetic biology.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Contributing}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Time Dependent Simulation (with optional conservation law reduction) using C\+V\+O\+DE
\item Supports S\+B\+ML Level 2 to 3 but currently excludes algebraic rules and delay differential equations
\item Uses latest lib\+S\+B\+ML distribution
\item Defaults to L\+L\+VM code generation on the backend, resulting is very fast simulation times
\item Optional generation of model C code and linking at run-\/time
\item Add plugins, distribution comes with Levenberg-\/\+Marquardt optimizer plugin
\item Compute steady state
\item Metabolic Control Analysis
\item Frequency Domain Analysis
\item Access to\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
\item Jacobian, full and reduced
\item Structural Matrices of the stoichiometry matrix
\end{DoxyItemize}
