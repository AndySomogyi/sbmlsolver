This model contains only a compartment, but it has a spatial dimension of 2.7.  The numerics are not affected at all; this simply tests that the existence of this dimensionality doesn't affect the simulation.

The model contains:
* 1 compartment (C)
The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:35em,margin: 1em auto}|       | *Value* | *Constant* |
| Initial volume of compartment 'C' | $4$ | constant |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
