/**
 * @brief This model is the same as SimpleFlux but the network has been reduced
 * using conservation analysis manually before encoding in sbml.
 *
 * @details The system we solve is:
 *      f(x) =
 *       dS1/dt = - kf*S1 + kb*S2
 *       dS2/dt = + kf*S1 - kb*S2
 * We use
 *  - kf = 0.1
 *  - kb = 0.01
 *  - S1 @t0 = 10
 *  - S2 @t0 = 1
 *  - TOTAL = S1 + S2
 *
 * The solution to f(x) = 0 is:
 *  - S1 = 1
 *  - S2 = 10
 *
 * To get to this solution, we need to do conservation
 * analysis. Otherwise the jacobian matrix is singular,
 * and cannot be inverted (to solve newton iteration).
 * For this, we note that S1 + S2 = TOTAL, where TOTAL
 * is constant. Therefore we can reduce this system of
 * 2 equations into 1 differential and 1 algebraic.
 *
 * The reduced system is:
 *      f(x) =
 *       Total = S1 + S2
 *       S2Conserved = (Total - S1)
 *       dS1/dt = - kf*S1 + kb*S2Conserved
 *
 * The equivalent roadrunner/tellurium code is:
 *
 *  def ss(s):
 *      m = te.loada(s)
 *      m.conservedMoietyAnalysis = True
 *      m.steadyState()
 *      print(m.getFloatingSpeciesConcentrationIds())
 *      print(m.getFloatingSpeciesConcentrations())
 *      print(m.getFullJacobian())
 *      print(m.getReducedJacobian())
 *      print(m.getReducedStoichiometryMatrix())
 *      print(m.getGlobalParameterIds())
 *      print(m.getGlobalParameterValues())
 *      return m
 *  r = ss("""
 *  model x
 *      S1 = 10;
 *      S20 = 1;
 *      Total = S1 + S20;
 *      S1 => ; - kf*S1 + kb*(Total - S1);
 *      S2 := Total - S1;
 *      kf = 0.1;
 *      kb = 0.01;
 *  end
 *  """)
 *  The expected output:
 *      ['[S1]']
 *      [1.]
 *              S1
 *      S1 [[ 0.11]]
 *
 *              S1
 *      S1 [[ 0.11]]
 *
 *            _J0
 *      S1 [[  -1]]
 *
 *      ['S20', 'Total', 'kf', 'kb', 'S2']
 *      [1.0e+00 1.1e+01 1.0e-01 1.0e-02 1.0e+01]
