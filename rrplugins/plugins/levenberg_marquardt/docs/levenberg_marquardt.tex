\section{Introduction}
The Levenberg-Marquardt plugin is used to fit an SBML model's parameters to experimental data.

The plugin has numerous properties to allow the user full control over the internal fitting engine, as well as
access to generated fitted data after a minimization session. In addition, various statistical properties, such as standardized residuals, Q-Q data, ChiSquare and reduced ChiSquare are made accessible to the user. The resulting parameter values also come with estimated confidence limits.

The current implementation is based on the lmfit C library by Joachim Wuttke\footnote{The package lmfit is distributed under the FreeBSD License:

Plugin properties are documented in the next section.

\section{The \texttt{execute(bool inThread)} function}
The \verb|execute()| function will start the \pname\ algorithm. Depending on the problem at hand, the algorithm may run for a long time.

The \verb|execute(bool inThread)| method supports a boolean argument indicating if the execution of the plugin work will be done in a thread, or not. Threading is fully implemented in the \pname\ plugin.

The inThread argument defaults to \textbf{false}.


\section{Plugin Events}
The Levenberg-Marquardt plugin are using all of a plugins available plugin events, i.e. the \emph{PluginStarted}, \emph{PluginProgress} and the \emph{PluginFinished} events.

The available data variables for each event are internally treated as \emph{pass through} variables, so any data, for any of the events, assigned prior to
the plugin's execute function (in the assignOn() family of functions), can be retrieved unmodified in the corresponding event function.
