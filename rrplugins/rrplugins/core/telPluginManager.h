/*! \mainpage A Plugin Framework for libRoadRunner

 \par
 This document describes libRoadRunners Plugins API. 
 \par
 The Plugins API is centered around the \a PluginManager, \a Plugin, and the \a Property classes. The Plugin manager is 
 responsible for validating, loading and unloading plugins at runtime.

 \par
 The Plugins themselves are self contained shared libraries that may be designed to extend the functionality of the main libRoadRunners core API.
 
 \par
 The capabilities of a Plugin is communicated to a client by the use of \a PluginProperties. A Plugin property is an object 
 able to communicate various types of data betwen the Plugin and the client, such as an int, double or a string. In addition to its value, plugin 
 properties have a name, hint and description field, assisting in communicating the purpose of the property.

 \par
 A client typically loads and configure a plugin, through the use of Properties, and then subsequently \a executes the plugin using the plugins
 execute function. Finally, the client may retrieve some kind of result from the Plugin, again, using a Property.

 \par
 Since a Plugins function will be determined by the actual Plugin author, documentation of a Plugins purpose and on how
 to use the plugin, is ideally bundled with the plugin and retrieved by various Plugin functions, e.g. getPluginInfo() and getPluginManualAsPDF().
