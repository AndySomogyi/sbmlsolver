Folder containing example/demo scripts demonstrating 'basic' plugin usage.

Any questions about the examples can be addressed to Totte Karlsson (totte@dunescientific.com)

OBSERVE: Make sure you have properly installed Tellurium plugins in your python environment 
before running any of these scripts. A good test is to execute 'import telplugins', with no quotes, at your python 
prompt. It should come back with no message.
