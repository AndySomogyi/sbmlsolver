.. currentmodule:: roadrunner

Import RoadRunner
-----------------

To startup RoadRunner use the commands at the Python prompt::

   import roadrunner
   rr = roadrunner.RoadRunner()

The variable ``rr`` is your reference to roadrunner. Anything you want to do with roadrunner must be
specified using the variable ``rr``.

To get the current version of libRoadRunner type the following::

   roadrunner.__version__

.. _loading-models:

Loading Models
--------------

RoadRunner reads models using the SBML format. If you have a SBML model stored on your hard drive, it is
possible to load that model either by giving he document contents or path to the Roadrunner
constructor, or later by using the method, :meth:`~RoadRunner.load()`. Let's assume you have a model called
mymodel.xml in ``C:\MyModels``. To load this model in **Windows** we would use the command::

   rr = roadrunner.RoadRunner("C:/MyModels/mymodel.xml")

Note, Windows typically used the back slash, '\\' to indicate a directory separator, however in
most languages including python, this is the escape character, therefore one can also enter Windows
paths using the forward slash '/' which does not cause issues. If one want to use the backslash,
these must be typed twice, i.e. ``'C:\\MyModels\\mymodel.xml'``.

On the **Mac or Linux** we might use::

   rr = roadrunner.RoadRunner("/home/MyModels/mymodel.xml")

RoadRunner can also load models directly from a URL via::

   rr = roadrunner.RoadRunner("http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/download?mid=BIOMD0000000010")

If the model was loaded successfully, the RoadRunner object is now ready to use,  otherwise an exception will
be raised that contains extended information detailing exactly what failed. If any warnings are
found in the SBML document, these will be displayed in the console error log.

Additionally, there are a couple models **included with libRoadRunner**. The models  ``feedback.xml``
and ``Test_1.xml`` are available in the ``roadrunner.testing`` module. To access these use::

   import roadrunner.testing as test
   r = test.getRoadRunner('feedback.xml')

There are a few additional models in the ``models/`` directory of the distribution, where you installed libRoadRunner.

Running Simulations
-------------------

Once a model is successfully loaded we can next run a time course simulation. To do this we use the
simulate method::

   result = rr.simulate()

The variable result will be a Python numpy array. The first column will contain time and the remaining columns will include
all the floating species. In the simulate method we didn't specify how long to do the simulation for or how many
points to generate.  By default the time start is set to zero, time end to 40 time units and the number of points to 500.
There are two ways to set these values to different values. The easiest is to add them to the called in the following
way::

   result = rr.simulate (0, 10, 100)

This means set the time start to zero, the time end to 10 and generate 100 points. This means that the simulation points
will be output in intervals of 0.1.

The simulate method also accepts a number of keyword arguments. These may be uses like::

  result = rr.simulate(0, 10, 100, reset=True, stiff=True)

For more details of the simulate method see :meth:`RoadRunner.simulate()`
The follow table summarizes the various options.

================  =============
 Option           Description
================  =============
start             Start time for simulation
end               End time for simulation. Setting 'end' will automatically change 'duration'
duration          Duration of the simulation. Setting 'duration' will automatically change 'end'
steps             Number of steps to generate
absolute          Absolute tolerance for the CVODE integrator
relative          Relative tolerance for the CVODE integrator
stiff             Tells the integrator to use the fully implicit backward difference stiff solver
reset             Resets the SBML state to the original values specified in the SBML.
structuredResult  If set (default is True), the result from simulate is a numpy structured array
                  with the column names set to the selections. This is required for plotting and
                  displaying a legend for each time series.
variableStep      Perform a variable step simulation. This lets the integrator choose the 
                  appropriate time step.
integrator        a string of either "cvode" for deterministic simulations, or "gillespie" for
                  stochastic simulations. 
plot              True or False, plot the results of the simulation. 
================  =============

One important point to note about simulate(). When simulate() is run, the concentration of
the floating species will naturally change. If simulate() is called a second time, the simulation
will start the simulation from the previous simulated values. This can be used to easily follow on
simulations. However there will be times when we wish to run the same simulation again but perhaps
with slightly different parameters values. To do this we must reset the initial conditions back to
the original values. To do that we run the command reset::

   rr.reset()

Changing Parameters
-------------------

Often during a modeling experiment we will need to change parameter values, that is the values of the various
kinetic constants in the model. If a model has a kinetic constants k1, then we can change or inspect the value using
the following syntax::

   print rr.model.k1
   rr.model.k1 = 1.2


Selecting Simulation Output
---------------------------

RoadRunner supports a range of options for selecting what data a simulation should return. For more
detailed information on selections, see the :ref:`selecting-values` section.

The simulate method, by default returns an `structured array
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.rec.html>`_,
which are arrays that also contain column names. These can be plotted directly using the
built in ``RoadRunner.plot()`` function, or by adding the ``plot=True`` keyword argument to ``simulate()``.

The output selections default to time and the set of floating species.
It is possible to change the simulation result values by changing the selection list.
For example assume that a model has three species, S1, S2, and S3 but we only want simulate() to
return time in the first column and S2 in the second column. To specify this we would type::

   rr.selections = ['time', 'S2']
   result = rr.simulate (0, 10, 100)

In another example let say we wanted to plot a phase plot where S1 is plotted against S2. To do this we
type the following::

   rr.selections = ['S1', 'S2']
   result = rr.simulate(0, 10, 100)

Some additional examples include:

   # Select time and two rates of change (dS1/dt and dS2/dt)
   rr.selections = ['time, 'S1''', 'S2''']

   # By default species names yield amounts, concentrations can be obtained
   # using square brackets, e.g.
   rr.selections = ['time', '[S1]', '[S2]']

.. seealso:: More details on :doc:`selecting_values`

.. _plotting-data:

Plotting Data
-------------

RoadRunner has a built in ``RoadRunner.plot()`` method which can perform basic plotting. 
Simply call::

   result = rr.simulate(0, 10, 100)
   rr.plot()

or::

  rr.simulate(0, 10, 100, plot=True)

If one wants more control over the data plots, one may use matplotlib directly.  Assuming the
simulate returns an array called result, and that the first column represents the x axis and the
remaining columns the y axis, we type::

   import pylab
   pylab.plot (result[:,0],result[:,1:])
   pylab.show()

This will bring up a new window showing the plot. To clear the plot for next time, type the command::

   pylab.clf()

One may also override the built in ``plot`` method with a more more capable plotting routine

Below is a simplified version of the ``RoadRunner.plot()`` method. You may copy and write a
customized version and even attach it to the RoadRunner object. The first argument is a RoadRunner
object instance, and the second is a flag which tells the method to show the plot or not::

  def plot(r, show=True):

      import pylab as p

      result = self.getSimulationData()

      if result is None:
          raise Exception("no simulation result")

      # assume result is a standard numpy array

      selections = r.selections

      if len(result.shape) != 2 or result.shape[1] != len(selections):
          raise Exception("simulation result columns not equal to number of selections,"
                          "likely a simulation has not been run")

      times = result[:,0]

      for i in range(1, len(selections)):
          series = result[:,i]
          name = selections[i]
          p.plot(times, series, label=str(name))

          p.legend()

      if show:
          p.show()


You can attach your plotting function to the RoadRunner object by simply setting the plot
method::

  def my_plot(r, show):
      pass

  import roadrunner
  roadrunner.RoadRunner.plot = my_plot

Now, whenever the ``RoadRunner.plot`` method is called, your plot function will be the one that is
invoked.


Changing Initial Conditions
---------------------------


There are a number of methods to get and set the initial conditions of a loaded model. In order to
specify a given initial conditions we use the notation, ``init(X)``.  The values stored in the
initial conditions are applied to the model whenever it is reset. The list of all initial condition
symbols can be obtained by the methods, :meth:`~ExecutableModel.getFloatingSpeciesInitAmountIds()`
and :meth:`~ExecutableModel.getFloatingSpeciesInitConcentrationIds()` assuming ``r`` is a roadunner
variable. As with all other selection symbols, the :meth:`~ExecutableModel.keys()` returns all
available selection symbols:

  >>>  r.model.keys()
  [ 'S1', 'S2', '[S1]', '[S2]', 'compartment', 'k1', 'cm0',
    'reaction1',  'init([S1])',  'init([S2])', 'init(S1)',
    'init(S2)',  "S1'"]

Symbols for selecting initial values specifically for amounts and concentrations can be obtained
via:

  >>> r.model.getFloatingSpeciesInitAmountIds()
  ['init(S1)', 'init(S2)']

  >>> r.model.getFloatingSpeciesInitConcentrationIds()
  ['init([S1])', 'init([S2])']

Getting or setting initial values is easily accomplished using the array operator and the selection
symbols:

  >>> r.model["init(S1)"]
  0.00015

  >>> r.model["init([S1])"]
  2.9999999999999997e-05

  >>> r.model["init([S1])"] = 2

  >>> r.model["init(S1)"]
  10.0

The values for the initial conditions for all floating species can be obtained using the calls:

  >>> r.model.getFloatingSpeciesInitConcentrations()
  array([ 0.7,  5.6])

Initial conditions can be set using the two methods for all species in one call:

  >>> r.model.setFloatingSpeciesInitAmounts ([3.4, 5.6])


  >>> r.model.setFloatingSpeciesInitConcentrations ([6.7, 0.1])
