RoadRunner Overview
===================

This guide is intended as an introduction and reference of the RoadRunner
SBML Simulation Engine. This guide will show the most important features 
and provides a complete API reference. 


To get you started here is a very simple script that will load a model and run a time course
simulation and plot the results::

   from roadrunner import *
   r = RoadRunner()
   r.load('mymodel.xml')
   result = r.simulate()
   plot(result)
 
The result is a standard numpy array which may be plotted using `matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.org/>`_. Now read the tutorials to learn more about the capabilities of RoadRunner.
