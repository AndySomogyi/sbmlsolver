What is libRoadRunner
*********************
RoadRunner is package for loading, JIT compilation, simulation and
analysis of SBML systems biology models.

Fundamental Objects
-------------------
The libRoadRunner package uses two fundametal objects e.g. ``rr`` of 
class ``RoadRunner`` and e.g. ``rr.model`` of class ``ExecutableModel``. 

**RoadRunner**
 - Typically the top level object
 - Responsible for orchestrating all of the internal components, such as model loading, 
   JIT compilation, integration and output.
 - Initialized with ``rr = roadrunner.RoadRunner()``


**ExecutableModel**
 - Represents a compiled sbml model
 - Properties to get and set any state variables.
 - Initialized when SBML is loaded ``r.load('mymodel.xml')``

The Python API is a very clean simple interface that uses all native Python objects. 
All the returned types are structured `Numpy` arrays. 


Example of libRoadRunner in Use
-------------------------------
Transcript from an Python session to demonstrate libRoadRunner use on this interactive Python console.
 

**Import** roardrunner and numpy::

   import roadrunner
   import roadrunner.testing
   import numpy as n
   import numpy.linalg as lin

**Load** an SBML model::

   rr = roadrunner.RoadRunner()
   rr.load(roadrunner.testing.get_data('Test_1.xml'))

\
     ::
   
      True

Get the **model**, the model object has all the accessors sbml elements, names, values::
   
   m = rr.getModel()

Use the built in RR function to get the **Jacobian**, notice this is returned as a native
numpy matrix, and display it::
   
   jac = rr.getFullJacobian()
   jac

\
     ::
   
      array([[-0.2  ,  0.067,  0.   ],
             [ 0.15 , -0.467,  0.09 ],
             [ 0.   ,  0.4  , -0.64 ]])

Get a vector of **floating species amounts**, and display it::

   amt = m.getFloatingSpeciesAmounts()
   amt

\
     ::
   
      array([ 0.1 ,  0.25,  0.1 ])

Look at the **floating species ids**::
   
   m.getFloatingSpeciesIds()

\
     ::
   
      ['S1', 'S2', 'S3']

Numpy has a huge amount of numeric capability, here we calculate
the **eigensystem from the Jacobian**.::

   lin.eig(jac)

\
     ::
   
      (array([-0.15726345, -0.38237134, -0.76736521]),
       array([[ 0.77009381, -0.19510707,  0.03580588],
              [ 0.49121122,  0.53107368, -0.30320915],
              [ 0.40702219,  0.82455683,  0.95225109]]))

Suppose we wanted to calculate the matrix vector product of the **jacobian with the 
floating species amounts**, its a single statement, since we use native types.::

   n.dot(jac, amt)

\
     ::

         array([-0.00325, -0.09275,  0.036  ])

Finally, you can of course **simulate over time**. The first column in result is time, 
the rest are whatever is selected. The easies way to plot is to use ``roadrunner.plot``::
   
   results = rr.simulate()
   roadrunner.plot(results)
   
.. seealso::  To get numpy unstructured array, see: :ref:`plotting-data`
   
Using libRoadRunner in `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ you can **get documentation** 
easily using a ``?`` after the object or method::

   rr.simulate?

\
     ::

      Type:       instancemethod
      String Form:<bound method RoadRunner.simulate of <roadrunner.RoadRunner() { this = 03D2E6F0 }>>
      File:       c:\python27\lib\site-packages\roadrunner\roadrunner.py


      Definition: rr.simulate(self, *args)
      Docstring:
      RoadRunner.simulate(*args)
      
      Simulate the current SBML model.
      
      There are a number of ways to call simulate.
      
      1. With no arguments. In this case, the current set of `SimulateOptions` will
         be used for the simulation. The current set may be changed either directly
         via setSimulateOptions() or with one of the two alternate ways of calling
         simulate.
      
      2: With single `SimulateOptions` argument. In this case, all of the settings
         in the given options are copied and will be used for the current and future
         simulations.
      
      3: With the three positions arguments, `timeStart`, `timeEnd`, `steps`. In this case
         these three values are copied and will be used for the current and future simulations.
      
      The options given in the 2nd and 3rd forms will remain in effect until changed. So, if
      one calls::
      
        rr.simulate (0, 3.14, 100)
      
      The start time of 0, end time of 3.14 and steps of 100 will remain in effect, so that if this
      is followed by a call to::
      
        rr.simulate()
      
      This simulation will use the previous values.
      
      :returns: a numpy array with each selected output timeseries being a
                column vector, and the 0'th column is the simulation time.
      :rtype: numpy.ndarray

Technical Footnotes
-------------------

.. [#] Much of the time, the Numpy array just holds a pointer to a block of data owned
       by RoadRunner, for example, the array returned by `rr.simulate()` just has a pointer 
       to the results matrix which is owned by the `RoadRunner`, so there is NO COPYING 
       involved. If you have no need for the result, just ignore it, it costs virtually 
       nothing to return it. 
       
.. [#] Current State of the System Group
       
       When using the LLVM back end, all model state calculation are automatically 
       performed using a techinque called lazy evaluation. If one sets the concentration 
       of a species, the amount of of that species is automatically available without 
       having to perform any addition operations. Similarly with any other value in the model. 
       
       If an SBML parameter is defined by an assigment rule or function and its value then 
       depends on a number of other values, simply setting to other values automatically 
       cause the value of the most dependent variable to be set. 
       
       This is identical how one operates in a spredsheet such as Microsoft Excel. For 
       example, if one has a cell with an equation that depends on other cell, and those
       other cell depend on other values, setting the value of any upstream cell automatically
       causes that value to cascade down to the terminal cells. The LLVM back end roadruner
       function identically.
