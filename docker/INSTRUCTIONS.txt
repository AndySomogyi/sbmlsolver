When updating (i.e. when Python comes out with a new version):

* Change roadrunner-manylinux2014/Dockerfile to reflect new python versions.
* Make sure docker is running (launching it on the lab mac works)
* Don't actually use the GUI; just use the command line, once it's running.
* Run the following commands:

cd roadrunner/docker/
docker build roadrunner-manylinux2014
docker images

* Note the IMAGE ID of the thing you just built (We'll say it's 5555):

docker tag 5555 sysbiouw/roadrunner-manylinux2014
docker login -u "sysbiouw" docker.io
docker push sysbiouw/roadrunner-manylinux2014



If you need to update one of the other images, follow the same instructions, but build up from -base to -add-deps, depending on what needs to be updated.  (i.e. if the deps need to be updated, do that first, then the Python with the one after that)

Make sure you build and push roadrunner-manylinux2014-base first, then roadrunner-manylinux2014-add-deps
