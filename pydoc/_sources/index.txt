RoadRunner Overview
===================

This guide is intended as an introduction and reference of the RoadRunner
SBML Simulation Engine. This guide will show the most important features 
and provides a complete API reference. 


.. warning::

   This "User Guide" is still a work in progress; some of the material
   is not organized, and several aspects of RoadRunner are not yet covered
   sufficient detail. <http://andysomogyi.github.io/roadrunner/pydoc/>`__ website.

To get you started here is a very simple script that will load a model and run a time course simulation::

  import roadrunner
  rr = roadrunner.RoadRunner()
  rr.loadSBMLFromFile ('mymodel.xml')
  result = rr.simulate()
 
The result is a standard numpy array which may be plotted using `matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.org/>`_. Now read the tutorials to learn more about the capabilities of RoadRunner.
