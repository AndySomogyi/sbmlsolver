Selecting Values
****************

RoadRunner support a wide range of options for selecting SBML and derivative values. Selections 
can be used to either retrive or in many cases, store values. We define SBML values as any element 
specified in the original SBML doucment, whereas derivative values are a
function of one or more SBML values. As these functions typically have no inverse, these are read
only selections.
