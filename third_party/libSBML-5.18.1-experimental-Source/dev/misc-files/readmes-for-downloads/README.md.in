##libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@

LibSBML is a free, open-source programming library to help you read,
write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data
streams. It is not an application itself (though it does come with
example programs), but rather a library you can embed in your own
applications.

This is the top-level directory of the libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ release. Here you
will find the following:

*  [Mac OS X](Mac%20OS%20X) -- folder of binary installers for Mac OS X systems
*  [Windows](Windows)  -- folder of binary installers for Microsoft Windows systems
*  [Linux](Linux)    -- folder of binary installers for Linux systems

*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-src.zip](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-src.zip)     -- source code (only), zip archive
*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-src.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-src.tar.gz)  -- source code (only), gzip'ed tar archive

*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-docs.zip](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-docs.zip)    -- formatted documentation (only)
*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-docs.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-docs.tar.gz) -- formatted documentation (only)

(Note about the documentation archives: after downloading an archive,
make sure to `unzip`/`untar` it before opening `docs/index.html`. If you
simply browse the compressed archive [e.g., using Windows Explorer],
the links inside `index.html` will not work.)
