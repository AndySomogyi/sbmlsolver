##libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@
###Installers for Linux operating systems

IMPORTANT: Please uninstall any existing copy of libSBML located in
the same destination before you install libSBML using this installer,
or you may end up with mixed versions of different libSBML components
on your system.

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML
for Linux systems.  All copies were built using the libxml2 XML parser
library.  The installer provides ONLY the core libSBML library (C/C++
interface); it does not include the other language bindings. 

Please navigate to either the [32-bit](32-bit) or [64-bit](64-bit) folders, to match the
version of the operating system you are using.

If you need the MATLAB or other language interfaces, or need to use a
different XML parser library, it will be necessary to build libSBML
yourself from the source distribution using suitable configuration
flags.  The procedure is described in the libSBML documentation.  The
source and documentation are available from the top-level download
directory, [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/)

For additional information about this version of libSBML, please see
