###Installers for 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems

IMPORTANT: Please uninstall any existing copy of libSBML located in
the same destination on your computer before you install libSBML using
these installers, or you may end up with mixed versions of different
libSBML components on your system.

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML
for Microsoft Windows 32-bit systems.  The copies of libSBML contained
here were built using the libxml2 XML parser library.  Here you will
find the following:

  * [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe)

      Complete libSBML binary distribution, containing the precompiled
      C/C++ libSBML core library and the following libSBML language
      interfaces: C# (Mono), Java, MATLAB, Octave, Perl, Python, Ruby.

  * [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-matlab-x86.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-matlab-x86.exe)

      Installer for the MATLAB libSBML interface ONLY.  Download this
      if you ONLY need to use libSBML from MATLAB.  (This installer is
      also contained within [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe), so if you
      downloaded that, you do NOT need to download and install this
      MATLAB interface installer in addition.)

  * [Python](Python)

      This folder contains installers for the Python libSBML interface
      ONLY, for different versions of Python.  Download and use one of
      these installers if you only need the Python interface.  (The
      interface is also included within [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-win-x86.exe), so
      if you downloaded that, you do NOT need to download and install
      the Python interface installer separately.)

To use these installers, simply download the appropriate file to your
computer, then run the file, and follow the instructions displayed by
the installer program on your screen.
