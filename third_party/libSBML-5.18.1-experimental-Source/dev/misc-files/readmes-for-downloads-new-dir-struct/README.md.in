## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@**

**LibSBML** is a free, open-source programming library to help you read, write, manipulate, translate, and validate [SBML](http://sbml.org) files and data streams. It is not an application itself (though it does come with example programs), but rather a library you can embed in your own applications.

This is the top-level directory of **release @PACKAGE_VERSION@** of libSBML. Here you will find the following:

*  **[stable](stable)**       -- subdirectory for the stable release of libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@.  This contains the fully tested source, documentation and binary installers that reflect the current stable libSBML core and any accepted SBML Level 3 packages.
  
*  **[experimental](experimental)** -- subdirectory for libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@ with beta package code. This contains source code for packages still in development, as well as binaries containing libSBML core together with all the packages included. Items in the [experimental](experimental) directory may be untested and undocumented, and are supplied as-is.
