## libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ 
### R interface installer for Windows

This directory contains the experimental R interface of libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@
generated for R 3.1.1 on Microsoft Windows operating systems. 

It has been tested and seems to work with R 2.15.3; R 3.0.0; R 3.1.2; R 3.2.2 and R 3.3.3. Please let us know if you find this is not the case.

Install with the following command:

	R CMD INSTALL <archivename>

Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the packages. Many of the corresponding SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of development.  The binaries available here may be untested.  They are supplied as-is for experimental and advanced development only.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about any aspects of this software.
