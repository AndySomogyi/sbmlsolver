## libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@
### Experimental installers for Mac OS X operating systems

This directory contains binary versions of libSBML compiled with plug-ins
supporting draft SBML Level 3 package specifications for Mac OS X systems.

#### R Source package

The R Source package for experimental code is available [here](../../source/R%20interface).

Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the packages. Many of the corresponding SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of development.  The binaries available here may be untested.  They are supplied as-is for experimental and advanced development only.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about any aspects of this software.
