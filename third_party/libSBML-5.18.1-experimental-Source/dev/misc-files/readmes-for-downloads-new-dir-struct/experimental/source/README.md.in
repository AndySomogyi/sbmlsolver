## libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@
### Experimental source code

This directory contains source code to libSBML plug-ins supporting draft SBML Level 3 package specifications.

To integrate one of these packages into your copy of libSBML 5, simply extract the package archive into the existing libSBML source directory. Alternatively, download the [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-source](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-source.zip) archive, which contains all the necessary code in the appropriate locations.  Then, rerun [http://www.cmake.org](CMake), and enable the package you just added using the appropriate check-box in the list of options presented by CMake.  For example, to enable the `groups` package, select `ENABLE_GROUPS` in the CMake GUI.  (Alternatively, you can run the command line version of CMake with the flag `-DENABLE_GROUPS=ON`.)

#### **_R source package_**

The folder [R interface](R%20interface) contains the R source package for libSBML experimental code.

Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the packages. Many of the corresponding SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of development.  The binaries available here may be untested.  They are supplied as-is for experimental and advanced development only.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about any aspects of this software.
