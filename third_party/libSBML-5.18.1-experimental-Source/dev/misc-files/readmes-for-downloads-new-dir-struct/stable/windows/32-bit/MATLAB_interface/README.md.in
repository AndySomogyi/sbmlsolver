## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ MATLAB interface installers for 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems**

**Important**: Before you install libSBML using these installers, please **uninstall any existing copy of libSBML** located in the same destination on your computer, or you may end up with mixed versions of different libSBML components on your system.


### **_MATLAB installers_**

This directory contains the MATLAB-only installers for libSBML.  Each file contains **only** the precompiled MATLAB interface.  Download this if you only need to use libSBML from MATLAB and do not need to use other programming languages with libSBML.


**Note:** The installer in the current directory and that in the Windows/32-bit directory are identical and duplicated purely to preserve continuity with the download URL and consistency with other OS directories.

### Help and support

For more information about the libSBML MATLAB interface, please see the [libSBML MATLAB API Documentation][1].

Please report any problems you encounter using libSBML either to the
developers directly (using the email address <libsbml-team@googlegroups.com>) or using the [issue tracker][2].

Thank you for your interest in libSBML!

The LibSBML Team.
