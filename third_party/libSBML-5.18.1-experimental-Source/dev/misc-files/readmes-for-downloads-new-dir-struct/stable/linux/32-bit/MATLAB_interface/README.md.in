## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ MATLAB binaries for 32-bit Linux**

This archive contains standalone binaries for the libSBML MATLAB interface for 32-bit Linux systems.  The interface files are ready to run; they require no compilation or additional steps beyond informing MATLAB about the path to the folder where you unpacked the archive.  Instructions for doing this are given below.

*Note*: It would be very useful for us to learn of people's experiences, both for situations where the binaries do not work as well as situations where they do work.  Please let us know by contacting us at <libsbml-team@googlegroups.com>.


### Installation instructions

1. Extract the archive somewhere on your local computer.

2. Start your copy of MATLAB and add the folder to your MATLAB path using [addPath](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html). 

3. Verify that everything works.  You can do this easily by changing into that folder within your running MATLAB environment, then issuing the command `TranslateSBML('test.xml')` in MATLAB.  If everything went as planned, the output of that command will be a MATLAB structure representing the toy test model.

4. Save the changes to your MATLAB path for future use.  To do this, you can use the [savepath](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/savepath.html) command in MATLAB.


### Help and support

For more information about the libSBML MATLAB interface, please see the [libSBML MATLAB API Documentation][1].

Please report any problems you encounter using libSBML either to the
developers directly (using the email address <libsbml-team@googlegroups.com>) or using the [issue tracker][2].

Thank you for your interest in libSBML!

The LibSBML Team.
