## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ installers for 32-bit Linux operating systems**

**Important**: Before you install libSBML using these installers, please **uninstall any existing copy of libSBML** located in the same destination on your computer, or you may end up with mixed versions of different libSBML components on your system.


### **_C, C++, C#, Java, Perl and Ruby installers_**

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ for 32-bit Linux systems.  They were built with the [http://www.xmlsoft.org](libxml2) parser library, and include accepted SBML Level 3 packages plus interfaces for the following programming languages:

* C
* C++
* C# (Mono)
* Java
* Perl
* Ruby
	
Files include:

* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.rpm](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.rpm) -- for RPM-based Linux distributions (Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS)
* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.deb](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86.deb) -- for Debian-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu & variants, Debian)
* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-centos.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-centos.tar.gz) -- an archive containing just the binary files built for CentOS
* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-ubuntu.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Linux-x86-binaries-ubuntu.tar.gz) -- an archive containing just the binary files built for Ubuntu

By default, the installer will put libSBML into `/usr`.  Detailed information about how to make libSBML accessible to your software [is available on a separate web page](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/docs/cpp-api/libsbml-accessing.html).

### **_MATLAB interface_**

[The main directory named "MATLAB interface"](../../MATLAB%20interface) contains the standalone binaries for the MATLAB libSBML interface **only**.  This is **not** included in the main installers.

### **_R source package_**

A source package for the libSBML R interface is available [here](../../R%20interface).  This is **not** included in the main installers.

### **_Python installers_**

If you are primarily interested in Python, we provide three options for installing libSBML for Python:

* **_Using PiPI_**: You can use the following command to install libSBML for Python: `sudo pip install python-libsbml`

* **_Using conda_**: You can install libSBML from the Anaconda Cloud: `conda install -c SBMLTeam python-libsbml`

* **_Using `apt-get` or `yum`_**: Python installers for use with `apt-get` or `yum` for various Linux distributions can be obtained from the [Open Build Service](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Afbergman%3Alibsbml&package=python-libsbml "Open Build Service").

After you have installed the Python libSBML library, follow the instructions for [how to access libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/docs/python-api/libsbml-accessing.html).

### **_Javascript/PHP interfaces_**

We do provide support for these languages but it will be necessary to build them for your system (see [Additional information](#add) below).

### **_Additional information_**
[add]:l

If you need to use a different XML parser library, it will be necessary to build libSBML yourself from the source distribution using suitable configuration flags.  The procedure is described in [the libSBML documentation](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/@PACKAGE_VERSION@/docs/cpp-api/libsbml-installation.html).  The source and documentation are available from the top-level download directory, [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@).

For additional information about this version of libSBML, please see the documentation or [visit the libSBML website](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML).

Thank you for your interest in libSBML!
