## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ installers for R for 32-bit Linux operating systems**

This directory contains the libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ package files for R.  

Please navigate to either the [Source Package](Source%20Package) or [Binary Package](Binary%20Package) folder to select your preferred installation method.  

The binary installation will provide a faster installation but will only work if the version of R being used matches the version used to create the installer (R v3.0 in this instance).  The source package will invoke a build within R and create the appropriate package for whichever R version is being used.
