## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental)**

**LibSBML** is a free, open-source programming library to help you read, write, manipulate, translate, and validate [SBML](http://sbml.org) files and data streams. It is not an application itself (though it does come with example programs), but rather a library you can embed in your own applications.

----------

### Experimental only release ###

An experimental only release updates those files usually located in the experimental directory of a full release. 

This includes updates to all the SBML L3 packages including those that are not yet
accepted and undergoing development.

NOTE: An experimental release is not as rigorously tested as a 
full release.  Any changes/fixes of either core, accepted packages or experimental code may change before the next full release.


----------



This is the top-level directory of **release @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental)** of libSBML.  Here you will find the following:

*  **[source](source)**   -- subdirectory for source code

*  **[binaries](binaries)** -- subdirectory for prebuilt binaries

Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of
development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the
packages. Many of the SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been
finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of
development.  The binaries available may be untested and are supplied 'as-is' for experimental development only.
