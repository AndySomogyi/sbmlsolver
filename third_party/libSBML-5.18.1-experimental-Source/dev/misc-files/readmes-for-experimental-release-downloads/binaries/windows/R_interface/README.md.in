## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental)**
###R interface for  Microsoft Windows operating systems

This directory contains the libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental) package files for R.  

### **_How to install libSBML for R_**

After downloading the installer archive file, you can use one of two approaches to installing the libSBML R interface in your environment:

* **_Using the R GUI_**: In the R menu **"Packages"** or **"Packages & Data"** (depending on your operating system), select the item **"Package Installer"**.  You will be presented with an interface that lets you install a local binary package.  Use the interface to navigate to the directory where you copied the libSBML archive file, and select the archive file for installation.

* **_Using a terminal/shell command_**: Suppose that the path to the libSBML R archive on your computer is _path_to_archive_. Execute the following command in a terminal/shell window (note: _not_ in the R command line interpreter!): **`R CMD INSTALL path_to_archive`**.  Here, **`R`** is the executable for the command-line version of R; we assume it is accessible from your shell's command line, but if it is not accessible by simply typing `R`, you may need to supply the full path to the R executable on your computer.

Once you have installed the R libSBML library, follow the instructions for [how to access libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/cpp-api/libsbml-accessing.html).

Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of
development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the
packages. Many of the SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been
finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of
development.  The binaries available may be untested and are supplied
'as-is' for experimental development only.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about this software.
