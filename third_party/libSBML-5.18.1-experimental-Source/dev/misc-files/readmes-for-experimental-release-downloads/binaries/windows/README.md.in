## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental)**
###Experimental installers for Microsoft Windows operating systems

This directory contains binary versions of libSBML compiled with plug-ins
supporting all SBML Level 3 package specifications for Microsoft Windows
systems.

We do not supply a windows installer, *per se*. The archives supplied include all the necessary library and include files as well as the relevant binaries for each of the language bindings. 

### **_Python installer_**

The [Python folder](Python) contains installers for the Python libSBML interface **only**.  Download and use one of these installers if you **only** need the Python interface.

### **_R installer_**

The [R interface](R%20interface) folder contains installer for the R libSBML interface **only**.

### **_MATLAB interface_**

[The main directory named "MATLAB interface"](../../MATLAB%20interface) contains the standalone binaries for the MATLAB libSBML interface **only**.  This is **not** included in the main installers.


Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of
development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the
packages. Many of the SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been
finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of
development.  The binaries available may be untested and are supplied
'as-is' for experimental development only.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about this software.
