## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental)**
###Experimental installers for Linux operating systems

This directory contains binary versions of libSBML compiled with plug-ins
supporting all SBML Level 3 package specifications for Linux systems.

**Important**: Before you install libSBML using these installers, please **uninstall any existing copy of libSBML** located in the same destination on your computer, or you may end up with mixed versions of different libSBML components on your system.


### **_C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Perl and Ruby installers_**

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental) for Linux systems.  They were built with the libxml2 parser library, and include all SBML Level 3 packages plus interfaces for the following programming languages:

* C
* C++
* C# (Mono)
* Java
* Javascript
* Perl
* Ruby

* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x64.rpm](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x64.rpm) -- for RPM-based Linux distributions (Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS)
* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x64.deb](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x64.deb) -- for Debian-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu & variants, Debian)


* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x64-binaries-centos.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x64-binaries-centos.tar.gz) -- an archive containing just the binary files built for CentOS
* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x64-binaries-ubuntu.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x64-binaries-ubuntu.tar.gz) -- an archive containing just the binary files built for Ubuntu


* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x86.rpm](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x86.rpm) -- for RPM-based Linux distributions (Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS)
* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x86.deb](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x86.deb) -- for Debian-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu & variants, Debian)


* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x86-binaries-centos.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x86-binaries-centos.tar.gz) -- an archive containing just the binary files built for CentOS
* [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x86-binaries-ubuntu.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-packages-Linux-x86-binaries-ubuntu.tar.gz) -- an archive containing just the binary files built for Ubuntu

By default, the installer will put libSBML into `/usr`.  Detailed information about how to make libSBML accessible to your software [is available on a separate web page](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/cpp-api/libsbml-accessing.html).

### **_R interface_**

[The directory named "source/R interface"](../../source/R%20interface) contains the source package for the R libSBML library.

### **_Python installers_**

If you are primarily interested in Python, we provide two better options for installing libSBML for Python:

* **_Using PiPI_**: First, make sure you have the following prerequisite software packages installed on your operating system: `python-dev`, `libxml2-dev`, `libz-dev`, and `libbz2-dev`.  Then, you can use the following command to install libSBML for Python: `sudo pip install python-libsbml`

* **_Using `apt-get` or `yum`_**: Python installers for use with `apt-get` or `yum` for various Linux distributions can be obtained from the [Open Build Service](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Afbergman%3Alibsbml&package=python-libsbml "Open Build Service").

After you have installed the Python libSBML library, follow the instructions for [how to access libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/libsbml-accessing.html).


### **_MATLAB interface_**

[The main directory named "MATLAB interface"](../../MATLAB%20interface) contains the standalone binaries for the MATLAB libSBML interface **only**.  This is **not** included in the main installers.

---
Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of
development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the
packages. Many of the SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been
finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of
development.  The binaries available may be untested and are supplied
'as-is' for experimental development only.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about this software.
