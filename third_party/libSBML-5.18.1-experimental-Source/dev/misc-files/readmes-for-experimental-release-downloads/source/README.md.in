Source code for core libSBML only:

*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-core-src.zip](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-core-src.zip)     -- source code (only), zip archive
*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-core-src.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-core-src.tar.gz)  -- source code (only), gzip'ed tar archive
  
Source code for stable libSBML (core SBML Levels 1-3 plus accepted SBML Level 3 packages):

*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-core-plus-packages-src.zip](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-core-plus-packages-src.zip)     -- source code (only), zip archive
*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-core-plus-packages-src.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-core-plus-packages-src.tar.gz)  -- source code (only), gzip'ed tar archive

Source code for experimental libSBML (core SBML Levels 1-3 plus all SBML Level 3 packages):

*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Source.zip](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-core-plus-packages-src.zip)     -- source code (only), zip archive
*  [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Source.tar.gz](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-core-plus-packages-src.tar.gz)  -- source code (only), gzip'ed tar archive

Source code for python (core plus all packages):

* [python-libsbml-experimental-@PACKAGE_VERSION@.tar.gz](python-libsbml-experimental-@PACKAGE_VERSION@.tar.gz)  -- source code for building the python binding for a Mac or Linux distribution. To install on Mac / Linux simply extract the archive, change into the directory and install using the `setup.py` script, for example: 

		tar zxf python-libsbml-experimental-@PACKAGE_VERSION@.tar.gz  
        cd python-libsbml-experimental-@PACKAGE_VERSION@
        sudo python setup.py install

	Alternatively, python installers for various Linux distributions can be obtained from the [Open Build Service](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Afbergman%3Alibsbml&package=python-libsbml-experimental "Open Build Service").

Code for each of the packages is available in the directories

* [accepted packages](accepted%20packages)  -- source code for packages that have been accepted
* [beta packages](beta%20packages)  -- source code for packages under development


Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of
development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the
packages. Many of the SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been
finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of
development.  The binaries available may be untested and are supplied
'as-is' for experimental development only.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about this software.
