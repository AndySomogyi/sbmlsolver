## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental)**
###Experimental source code for packages under development

This directory contains source code for libSBML plug-ins supporting draft SBML Level 3 package specifications.

To integrate one of these packages into your copy of libSBML 5, simply
extract the package archive into the existing libSBML source
directory. Alternatively, download the [libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Source](libSBML-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-Source.zip)
archive, which contains all the necessary code in the appropriate
locations.  Then, rerun CMake, and enable the package you just added using
the appropriate check-box in the list of options presented by CMake.  For
example, to enable the `groups` package, select `ENABLE_GROUPS` in the CMake
GUI.  (Alternatively, you can run the command line version of CMake with the
flag `-DENABLE_GROUPS=ON`.)

Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of
development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the
packages. Many of the SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been
finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of
development.  The binaries available may be untested and are supplied
'as-is' for experimental development only.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about this software.
