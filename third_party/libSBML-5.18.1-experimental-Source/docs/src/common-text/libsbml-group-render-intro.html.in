<p> The libSBML &ldquo;render&rdquo; extension implements support for the SBML
Level&nbsp;3 <em>Graphical Rendering</em> ("render") package.  It can be used
in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 and Version&nbsp;2 documents.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The graphical depiction of a reaction network diagram should be described
  as graphical representations of species and reactions, and not as arbitrary
  drawing or graph.  While it may seem unnecessary to invent a new language
  when an existing one like SVG could in principle be used to describe the
  layout of a reaction network, there are good reasons to have a language
  tailored specifically for the layout of SBML models.  For example, most
  programs that will use this SBML extension are primarily programs dealing
  with biochemical models.  Internally, they will have data structures for
  species and reactions, so it will also be natural for them to depict the
  reaction network in terms of species and reactions (and not in terms of,
  e.g., polygons or splines).

  <p> The Graphical Rendering ("render") package for SBML Level&nbsp;3 is a
  companion to the Graphical Layout ("layout") package.  Together, they
  provide a complete format for describing the layout of a diagram
  and the visual rendition of the entities within it.

 <h2>Authors</h2>

 The primary authors of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Render specification are Frank
 T. Bergmann, Sarah M. Keating, Ralph Gauges, Sven Sahle and Katja Wengler.
