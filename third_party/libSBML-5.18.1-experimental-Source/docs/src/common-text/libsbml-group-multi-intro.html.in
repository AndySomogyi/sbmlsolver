<p> The libSBML &ldquo;multi&rdquo; extension implements support for the SBML Level&nbsp;3 <em>Multistate, Multicomponent and Multicompartment Species</em> package.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The SBML Level&nbsp;3 Multistate, Multicomponent and Multicompartment Species (multi) package provides an extension of SBML Level&nbsp;3 that supports encoding models with molecular complexes that have multiple components and can exist in multiple states and in multiple compartments. One of its goals also is to provide a platform for sharing models based on the specifications of bimolecular interactions and the rules governing such interactions.  In addition, this specification includes features to support multicompartment species (species that are described as residing in more than one compartment).

<h2>Authors</h2>

The primary authors of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Multistate, Multicomponent and Multicompartment Species specification are Fenkgai Zhang and Martin Meier-Schellersheim.
