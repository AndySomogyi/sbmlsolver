 * @class Deletion
 * @sbmlbrief{comp} %Deletion of an object from a submodel.
 *
 * The Deletion class was introduced by the SBML Level&nbsp;3 @ref comp
 * (&ldquo;comp&rdquo;) package to allow elements of submodels to be removed
 * before instantiation.

 * The Deletion object class is used to define a deletion operation
 * to be applied when a submodel instantiates a model definition.
 * Deletions may be useful in hierarchical model composition scenarios for
 * various reasons.  For example, some components in a submodel may be
 * redundant in the composed model, perhaps because the same features are
 * implemented in a different way in the new model.

 * Deletions function as follows.  When the Model to which the Submodel
 * object refers (via the "modelRef" attribute) is read and processed for
 * inclusion into the composed model, each Deletion object identifies an
 * object to remove from that Model instance.  The resulting submodel
 * instance consists of everything in the Model object instance minus the
 * entities referenced by the list of Deletion objects.
 * 
 * As might be expected, deletions can have wide-ranging implications,
 * especially when the object deleted has substantial substructure, as in
 * the case of reactions.  The following are rules regarding deletions and
 * their effects.
 * 
 * @li An object that has been deleted is considered inaccessible.
 * Any element that has been deleted (or replaced)
 * may not be referenced by an SBaseRef object.
 * @li If the deleted object has child objects and other structures, the
 * child objects and substructure are also considered to be deleted.
 * @li It is not an error to delete explicitly an object that is already
 * deleted by implication (for example as a result of the second point
 * above).  The resulting model is the same.
 * @li If the deleted object is from an SBML namespace that is not
 * understood by the interpreter, the deletion must be ignored---the 
 * object will not need to be deleted, as the interpreter could not
 * understand the package.  If an interpreter cannot tell whether 
 * a referenced object does not exist or if exists in an unparsed namespace
 * it may produce a warning.
 *
 * The Deletion object class is subclassed from SBaseRef, and reuses all the 
 * machinery provided by SBaseRef.  In addition, it defines two optional 
 * attributes, "id" and "name".  The "id" attribute can be used to give an
 * identifier to a given deletion operation.  The identifier has no
 * mathematical meaning, but it may be useful for creating submodels that
 * can be manipulated more directly by other submodels.  (Indeed, it is
 * legitimate for an enclosing model definition to delete a deletion!)
 *
 * The optional "name" attribute is provided on Deletion for the
 * same reason it is provided on other elements that have identifiers;
 * viz., to provide for the possibility of giving a human-readable name to
 * the object.  The name may be useful in situations when deletions are
 * displayed to modelers.
