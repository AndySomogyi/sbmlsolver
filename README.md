## Introduction

libRoadRunner is a high performance and portable simulation engine for systems and synthetic biology.

## Contributing

**IMPORTANT!** Contributors **must** follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner/wiki). Contibuters are responsible for complying with the guidelines, including (but not limited to) making commits to the correct branch. Maintainers are not responsible for changes made to the wrong branch. Contributors take full responsibility for ensuring that their changes get merged into the develop branch.

## libRoadRunner supports the following features:

* Time Dependent Simulation (with optional conservation law reduction) using CVODE
* Supports SBML Level 2 to 3 but currently excludes algebraic rules and delay differential equations
* Uses latest libSBML distribution
* Defaults to LLVM code generation on the backend, resulting is very fast simulation times
* Optional generation of model C code and linking at run-time
* Add plugins, distribution comes with Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer plugin
* Compute steady state
* Metabolic Control Analysis
* Frequency Domain Analysis
* Access to:
  * Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
  * Jacobian, full and reduced
  * Structural Matrices of the stoichiometry matrix


## Availability

RoadRunner is licensed for free as an open source programmatic library for use in other 
applications and as a standalone command line driven application. Its C++ API, C API, and 
Python APIs have comprehensive documentation. On Windows, OS X, and Linux binary files can be 

downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libroadrunner/files and can be installed 
ready for use.
