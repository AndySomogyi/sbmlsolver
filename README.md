# Summary

libRoadRunner is a C/C++ library that supports simulation of SBML based models. It uses LLVM) to generate extremely high performance code and is the fastest SBML-based simulator currently available (ref). Its main purpose is for use as a reusable library that can be hosted by other applications, particularly on large compute clusters for doing parameter optimization where performance is critical. It also has a set of python bindings that allow it to be easily used from python. 

We provide C/C++, Python and Julia bindings.

# Documentation

# Installation

[Binaries](https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner/releases) for Windows, MacOS (including universal binaries for the M1 processor), and Linux

Python wheels are available at the above binaries link, and can also be installed via pip:

`pip install libroadrunner`

# Example Python usage

Once installed in Python (using pip or using the wheels directly), the following simple example script should demonstrate the basics of a roadrunner simulation:

```python
import roadrunner
rr = roadrunner.RoadRunner("https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/model/download/BIOMD0000000010.2?filename=BIOMD0000000010_url.xml")
results = rr.simulate(0, 2000, 200)
rr.plot()
print(results)
```

This simple script downloads [BioModels 10](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000010) (the Kholodenko model of MAPK oscillation) and runs a simulation for 2000 seconds, storing the results in `results`.  If your system is set up to display figures, it will display a plot of the simulation, then print the numerical values obtained.

# Dependencies

All libRoadRunner binaries are self-contained, and should include all libraries it depends on.  When building libRoadRunner from source, its dependencies may either be downloaded *en masse* from the [libroadrunner-deps](https://github.com/sys-bio/libroadrunner-deps) repository, may be obtained directly from their [respective sources](https://github.com/sys-bio/libroadrunner-deps/tree/release/third_party), or the libraries may be installed directly on your operating system.  Compilation requires a C++17 compiler.

The one exception to the above is that the libRoadRunner binaries depend on the 'ncurses' library on linux.

## Contributing

Contributors may submit pull requests at any time, and are asked to follow some general [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner/wiki).  Bug requests and feature suggestions are also welcomed on the [issues page](https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner/issues).

## libRoadRunner supports the following features:

* Time Dependent Simulation (with optional conservation law reduction) using CVODE
* Supports SBML Level 2 to 3 but currently excludes algebraic rules and delay differential equations
* Uses latest libSBML distribution
* Defaults to LLVM code generation on the backend, resulting is very fast simulation times
* Optional generation of model C code and linking at run-time
* Add plugins, distribution comes with Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer plugin
* Compute steady state
* Metabolic Control Analysis
* Frequency Domain Analysis
* Access to:
  * Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
  * Jacobian, full and reduced
  * Structural Matrices of the stoichiometry matrix


## Availability

RoadRunner is licensed for free as an open source programmatic library for use in other 
applications and as a standalone command line driven application. Its C++ API, C API, and 
Python APIs have comprehensive documentation. On Windows, OS X, and Linux binary files can be 
downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner/releases) page, and the 
Python bindings can additionally be downloaded via pip. 


## Docker images
Currently we have a manylinux2014 [build](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sysbiouw/roadrunner-manylinux2014-base) docker image. The 
base provides the environment you need to be able to build roadrunner yourself on manylinux2014 (centos 8).  

To get the base image: 

`docker pull sysbiouw/roadrunner-manylinux2014-base:llvm-13.x`

Docker build scripts can be found under the `docker` directory from the roadrunner
root directory. 

We can also build roadrunner in alternative docker environments (ubuntu etc.) on request.
