   via setSimulateOptions() or with one of the two alternate ways of calling
   simulate.

2: With single `SimulateOptions` argument. In this case, all of the settings
   in the given options are copied and will be used for the current and future
   simulations.

3: With the three positions arguments, `timeStart`, `timeEnd`, `steps`. In this case
   these three values are copied and will be used for the current and future simulations.

The options given in the 2nd and 3rd forms will remain in effect until changed. So, if
one calls::

  rr.simulate (0, 3.14, 100)

The start time of 0, end time of 3.14 and steps of 100 will remain in effect, so that if this
is followed by a call to::

steady state has been found. If necessary the method can be called a
second time to improve the solution.

%feature("docstring") rr::SimulateOptions::steps "


The number of steps at which the output is sampled. The samples are evenly spaced.
When a simulation system calculates the data points to record, it will typically
divide the duration by the number of time steps. Thus, for X steps, the output
will have X+1 data rows.
";



%feature("docstring") rr::SimulateOptions::stiff "


Use the stiff integrator.
";



%feature("docstring") rr::SimulateOptions::variables "


The variables (in addition to time) whose values will be saved in the result.
These are SBML model id's. Order is significant, as this determines the order
of the columns in the result matrix.

Important: if a symbol in this list refers to a species in the model,
then that symbol should also be listed in either the amount or concentration
lists below. If a species symbol is listed in variables, but is not listed
in either amounts or concentrations, then it defaults to an amount value.

The ordering of the symbols in variabls is what determines the output
ordering. The order of symbols in either amounts or concetrations do not
effect the output ordering.

NOTE:If a listed variable has two underscores in it ('__'), that variable
is actually present only in a submodel of the main model, from the
Hierarchical Model Composition package, in the format submodelID__variableID.
If the model is flattened, the variable will appear automatically.
