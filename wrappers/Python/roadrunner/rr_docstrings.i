%feature("docstring") rr::ExecutableModel::keys "
ExecutableModel.keys()

Get a list of all the keys that this model has. This is a very good way of looking at all the
available symbols and selection strings:

>>>  r.model.keys()
[ 'S1', 'S2', '[S1]', '[S2]', 'compartment', 'k1', 'cm0',
  'reaction1',  'init([S1])',  'init([S2])', 'init(S1)',

";



%feature("docstring") rr::ExecutableModel::items "
ExecutableModel.items()

Get a list of key / value pairs of all the selections / values in this model.

.. method:: ExecutableModel.__getitem__

Implements the python ``[]`` indexing operator, so the model values can be accessed like::

  >>> r.model[\"S1\"]
  0.0

.. method:: ExecutableModel.__setitem__

Implements the python ``[]`` indexing operator for setting values::

  >>> r.model[\"S1\"] = 12.3

Note, some keys are read only such as values defined by rules, or calculated values such as
species amount rates or reaction rates. If one attempts to set the value of a read-only symbol,
an exception is raised indicating the error, and no harm done.

you can update the initial conditions at any time, and it does not affect the current state of the
model. To reset the model, that is, reset it to its original state, or a new original state where
what has changed the initial conditions use the :meth:`~ExecutableModel.reset()` method.

%feature("docstring") rr::Logger::setFormattingPattern "
Logger.setFormattingPattern(format)

Internally, RoadRunner uses the Poco logging framework, so we
can custom format logging output based on a formatting pattern
string.

The format pattern is used as a template to format the message and
is copied character by character except for the following special characters,
which are replaced by the corresponding value.

An example pattern of \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %p: %t\" set via::

  roadrunner.Logger.setFormattingPattern(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %p: %t\")

would produce the following output:

.. image:: logging2.png

RoadRunner supports the following format specifiers. These were copied from the Poco documentation:

* %s - message source
* %t - message text
* %l - message priority level (1 .. 7)
* %p - message priority (Fatal, Critical, Error, Warning, Notice, Information, Debug, Trace)

%feature("docstring") rr::Config::SIMULATEOPTIONS_INITIAL_TIMESTEP "
:annotation: double

A user specified initial time step. If this is <=  0, the integrator
will attempt to determine a safe initial time step.

Note, for each number of steps given to RoadRunner::simulate or RoadRunner::oneStep,
the internal integrator may take many many steps to reach one of the external time
steps. This value specifies an initial value for the internal integrator
time step.
";



%feature("docstring") rr::Config::SIMULATEOPTIONS_MINIMUM_TIMESTEP "
:annotation: double

Specify The Minimum Time Step That The Internal Integrator
Will Use. Uses Integrator Estimated Value If <= 0.
";



%feature("docstring") rr::Config::SIMULATEOPTIONS_MAXIMUM_NUM_STEPS "
:annotation: int

Specify The Maximum Number Of Steps The Internal Integrator Will Use
Before Reaching The User Specified Time Span. Uses The Integrator
Default Value If <= 0.

%feature("docstring") rr::Config::ROADRUNNER_DISABLE_PYTHON_DYNAMIC_PROPERTIES "
:annotation: int

RoadRunner by default dynamically generates accessors properties
for all SBML symbol names on the model object when it is retrieved
in Python. This feature is very nice for interactive use, but
can slow things down. If this feature is not needed, it
can be disabled here.
";



%feature("docstring") rr::Config::ROADRUNNER_DISABLE_WARNINGS "
:annotation: int

disable SBML conserved moiety warnings.

Conserved Moiety Conversion may cause unexpected behavior, be aware of what it
is before enabling.

RoadRunner will issue a warning in steadyState if conservedMoieties are NOT
enabled because of a potential singular Jacobian. To disable this warning,
set this value to 1

A notice will be issued whenever a document is loaded and conserved moieties
are enabled. To disable this notice, set this value to 2.

To disable both the warning and notice, set this value to 3

Rationale for these numbers: This is actual a bit field, disabling the steady state
warning value is actually 0b01 << 0 which is 1, and the loading warning is 0b01 << 1
which is 2 and 0b01 & 0b10 is 0b11 which is 3 in decimal.

%feature("docstring") rr::PyConservedMoietyConverter::setDocument "
PyConservedMoietyConverter.setDocument(sbmlOrURI)

Sets the source document. This may be either the contents of an sbml docment
as a string, or the path the the file.

:param str sbmlOrURI: contents or path of source document
:returns: an integer indicating success or failure, 0 means success.
:rtype: int
";



%feature("docstring") rr::PyConservedMoietyConverter::convert "
PyConservedMoietyConverter.convert()

Perform the document conversion.

:returns: an integer indicating success or failure, 0 means success.
:rtype: int
";



%feature("docstring") rr::PyConservedMoietyConverter::getDocument "
PyConservedMoietyConverter.getDocument()

Get the converted document contents.

:returns: The contents of the converted document, or empty string
          if there is no source document.
