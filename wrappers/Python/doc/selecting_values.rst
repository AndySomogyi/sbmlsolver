.. currentmodule:: RoadRunner

RoadRunner supports wide range of options for selecting SBML and derivative values. Selections can
be used to either retrieve or store values. We define SBML values as any element
specified in the original SBML document, whereas derivative values are a function of one or more
SBML values. As these functions typically have no inverse, these are read only selections.

Selections are used a number of RoadRunner methods. They are used to determine what columns are
selected in a simulation result and can also be used to directly select model values. 

Selection syntax
________________
The selection syntax is case sensitive (SBML elements are case sensitive), however it ignores all
white space. 

Selection Types:

Time: ``time``
    The string ``time`` is interpreted as the current model time. 

Identifier 
    Any continuous sequence of printing characters is treated as an SBML identifier with
    the exception of ``time``, i.e. ``S1``, ``P1``, ``J0_Keq1``, ``compartment``, etc. 
    These have to be valid SBML identifiers. If no SBML identifier is found, an exception is raised. 
    Note that if the identifier is a chemical species, it is interpreted as the species amount. 

Concentration : ``[]``
    Following generally accepted chemical nomenclature, any continuous sequence of characters inside 
    a pair of squared brackets, ``[]`` is interpreted as a concentration, i.e. ``[S1]``, ``[S2]``, etc. 
    The identifier must be a valid SBML species, otherwise an exception is raised. 

Rates of Change: ``'``
    Represents the rate of change, :math:`\frac{dy}{dt}` of a species amount. Rates of change
    selections follow generally accepted mathematical convention of using the single quote, ``'`` 
    to represent a time derivative. A rate of change selection is any identifier followed by a
    single quote, i.e. ``S1'``, ``S2'``, ``P1'``, etc. A rates of change selection
    is also valid for SBML elements which are defined by rate rules. 

Elasticity: ``ee(ReactionId, ParameterId)``
    Represents elasticity slection in the form of ``ee(ReactionId, ParameterId)`` where ``ReactionId`` is a reaction name
    and ``ParameterId`` is a global parameter id. This selection intentionally has a function form, it
    selects the elasticity control coefficient, :meth:`~RoadRunner.getEE`

Unscaled Elasticity: ``uee(ReactionId, ParameterId)``
    Represents unscaled elasticity slection in the form of ``uee(ReactionId, ParameterId)`` where ``ReactionId`` 
    is a reaction name and ``ParameterId`` is a global parameter id. This selection intentionally has a function form, it
    selects the elasticity control coefficient, :meth:`~RoadRunner.getuEE`

Control Coefficient: ``cc(Id, ParameterId)``
    Represents control coefficient selection in the form of ``cc(Id, ParameterId)`` where ``Id`` is
    a flux or species name and ``ParameterId`` is a global parameter id. The string ``Id`` and ``ParameterId`` 
    must be valid arguments	for :meth:`~RoadRunner.getCC`. This selection intentionally has a function form, it 
    selects the elasticity control coefficient, :meth:`~RoadRunner.getCC`

Unscaled Control Coefficient: ``ucc(Id, ParameterId)``
    Represents unscaled control coefficient selections in the form of ``ucc(Id, ParameterId)`` where `Id`` is
    a flux or species name and ``ParameterId`` is a global parameter id. The string ``Id`` and ``ParameterId`` 
    must be valid arguments for :meth:`~RoadRunner.getuCC`. This selection intentionally has a function form, it
    selects the unscaled elasticity control coefficient, :meth:`~RoadRunner.getuCC`

Eigenvalue: ``eigenReal()``, ``eigenImag()`` 
    Represents the eigenvalue of a floating species. ``eigenReal(identifier)`` is the real part of eigenvalue while
    ``eigenImag(identifier)`` is the imaginary part of eigenvalue.

Initial Value: ``init()``
    Represents the initial value of an identifier specified in the SBML document, i.e. ``init(S1)``.

Stoichiometry: ``stoich(ParameterId, ReactionId)``
    Represents the stoichiometric coefficient for a given species and reaction.

Experimenting With Selections
-----------------------------
One might try individual selection string using the :meth:`~roadrunner.RoadRunner.getValue()` method. This
takes a selection string, determines if it is valid, and returns the value it selects. For example::


    >>> rr.getValue("cc(S1, J4_KS4)")
    -0.42955738179207886

Even though they are almost always specified by a string, RoadRunner selections are actually
objects. One can create a selection object using :meth:`~roadrunner.RoadRunner.createSelection()`. In
order to see extended information about the selection, try::

    >>> sel = rr.createSelection("cc(S1, J4_KS4)")
    >>> sel
    SelectionRecord({'index' : -1, 'p1' : 'S1', 'p2' : 'J4_KS4', 'selectionType' : CONTROL})

We can see that this is a CONTROL record. 

It is also possible to modify the simulation selection list by deleting existing items and adding
new ones created with :meth:`~roadrunner.RoadRunner.createSelection()`. If someone has does not want to display
the concentration of species ``S2`` and instead wants to display the rate of change of species
``S1``, try::

    >>> rr.timeCourseSelections
    ["time", "[S1]", "[S2]", "[S3]", "[S4]"]

    >>> sel = rr.createSelection("S1'")
    >>> rr.timeCourseSelections[2] = sel
    >>> rr.timeCourseSelections
    ["time", "[S1]", "S1'", "[S3]", "[S4]"]

Even though the selection list intentionally appears as a list of strings, it is actually a list of
selection objects. So, elements that are inserted or appended to this list must be selection objects
created by :meth:`~roadrunner.RoadRunner.createSelection()`.



Selecting Simulation Results
----------------------------
The columns of the RoadRunner simulation results are determined by the :attr:`~RoadRunner.timeCourseSelections` 
property. This is a list of what values will be displayed in the result, and can be set simply by::

    >>>  rr.timeCourseSelections = ['time', '[S1]', 'S1', "S1'"]

This example selects the columns ``time``, concentration of ``S1``, amount of ``S1``, and rate of change
of ``S1``. One may also have derivative values in the simulation selection, for example, if one
wanted to plot the elasticity of a particular reaction ``J1``::

    >>>  rr.timeCourseSelections = ['time', '[S1]', "ee(J1, P1)"]
