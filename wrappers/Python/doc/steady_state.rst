The dynamics of a biochemical network is described by the system equation

.. math::

   \frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{s}(t) = \mathbf{N} \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{s}(t),\mathbf{p},t), 

where :math:`\mathbf{s}` is the vector of species concentrations, :math:`\mathbf{p}` 
is a vector of time independent parameters, and :math:`t` is time. The steady state is the solution to
the network equations when all the rates of change are zero. That is the concentrations of the floating
species, :math:`\mathbf{s}` that satisfy:

.. math::

   \mathbf{N} \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{s}(t),\mathbf{p},t) = 0 
   
The steady state is easily calculated using the steady state method:

    >>> rr.steadyState()
    1.234567E-9
    
The call to ``steadyState`` returns a value that represents the sum of squares of the rates of change. Therefore the
smaller this value the more likely the steady state solution has been found. Often a value less that 10E-6 indicates
a steady state has been found. After a successful call all the species levels will be at their steady state values.

Steady state values can be obtained using :meth:`~RoadRunner.getSteadyStateValues` and :meth:`~RoadRunner.steadyStateSelections` can be used to 
decide what values to return. For example the following would retrieve a single value:

     >>> rr.steadyStateSelections = ['S1']
     >>> rr.getSteadyStateValues()
     array([ 0.54314239])


The following methods deal with steady state analysis:
