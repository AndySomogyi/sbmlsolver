The stability of a biochemical system is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. Given 
:math:`m` floating species and :math:`n` reactions, the Jacobian matrix is defined as follows:


.. math::

     J=\begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{\partial F_1}{\partial S_1} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial F_1}{\partial S_m} \\ 
     \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \dfrac{\partial F_n}{\partial S_1} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial F_n}{\partial S_m}  
     \end{bmatrix}

where :math:`F_i` is the ith differential equation and :math:`S_i` the ith floating species. From RoadRunner it is easy to obtain the Jacobian matrix using :meth:`RoadRunner.getFullJacobian`, i.e.::

    Jac = rr.getFullJacobian()

which returns the Jacobian matrix in the variable Jac.

It is possible for full Jacobian to be singular. In these situations one should call the related method, :meth:`RoadRunner.getReducedJacobian`.
