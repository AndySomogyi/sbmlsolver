Accessing the SBML Model Variables
__________________________________

All of the SBML model variables are accessed via the ``RoadRunner.model`` object. This is an instance of
the ExecutableModel class described here. One always access the model object that belongs to the top
RoadRunner object, i.e. ``r.model``, where ``r`` is an instance of the ``RoadRunner`` class. 

The ExecutableModel class also implements the Python dictionary protocol, so that it can be used as
a dictionary. The dictionary keys are all of the symbols specified in the original model as well as
a number of selection strings described in the Selections section. 

.. method:: ExecutableModel.keys()
   :module: roadrunner

   Get a list of all the keys that this model has. This is a very good way of looking at all the
   available symbols and selection strings:

   >>>  r.model.keys()
   [ 'S1', 'S2', '[S1]', '[S2]', 'compartment', 'k1', 'cm0',  
     'reaction1',  'init([S1])',  'init([S2])', 'init(S1)',  
     'init(S2)',  "S1'"]


.. method:: ExecutableModel.items()
   :module: roadrunner

   Get a list of key / value pairs of all the selections / values in this model. 

.. method:: ExecutableModel.__getitem__
   :module: roadrunner

   Implements the python ``[]`` indexing operator, so the model values can be accessed like::

     >>> r.model["S1"]
     0.0

.. method:: ExecutableModel.__setitem__
   :module: roadrunner

   Implements the python ``[]`` indexing operator for setting values::

     >>> r.model["S1"] = 12.3

   Note, some keys are read only such as values defined by rules, or calculated values such as
   species amount rates or reaction rates. If one attempts to set the value of a read-only symbol,
   an exception is raised indicating the error, and no harm done. 



Floating Species
----------------

   :module: roadrunner

   get all the amounts::

     >>> e.getFloatingSpeciesAmounts()
     [15,2,3,20]

   get amounts 3 and 0::

     [10,15]


.. method:: ExecutableModel.setFloatingSpeciesAmounts([index], values)

   :param numpy.ndarray index: (optional) an index array indicating which items to set,
                               or if no index array is given, the first param should be

Floating Species Initial Conditions
-----------------------------------
RoadRunner stores all initial conditions separately from the model state variables. This means that
you can update the initial conditions at any time, and it does not affect the current state of the
model. To reset the model, that is, reset it to its original state, or a new original state where
what has changed the initial conditions use the :meth:`~ExecutableModel.reset()` method. 

The following methods allow access to the floating species initial condition values:

   output variables will be written to.

   not update the initial species condition from which the values were calculated.

   values to set. If index is given, then  values should have the same
   length as index.

   :param numpy.ndarray index: (optional) an index array indicating which items to set,
                               or if no index array is given, the first param should be an
