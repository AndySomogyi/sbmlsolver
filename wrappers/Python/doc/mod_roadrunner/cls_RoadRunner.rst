The Main RoadRunner Class
_________________________

.. class:: RoadRunner

   The main RoadRunner class. Its objects, i.e. ``rr = RoadRunner()`` perform 
   the libRoaRunner functions, i.e. ``rr.simulate()``.



.. method:: RoadRunner.__init__(uriOrSBML = "", options = None)

   Creates a new RoadRunner object. If the first argument is specified, 
   it should be a string containing either the contents of an SBML document, 
   or a formatted URI specifying the path or location of a SBML document. 

   If options is given, it should be a LoadSBMLOptions object. 

   If no arguments are given, a document may be loaded at any future time
   using the load method. 

   :param uriOrSBML: a URI, local path or SBML document contents.
   :type name: str (optional)

   :param options: (LoadSBMLOptions) an options object specifying how the 
                   SBML document should be loaded
   :type name: str (optional)


.. method:: RoadRunner.load(uriOrDocument)
   :module: RoadRunner

   Loads an SBML document, given a string for file path, URI, or contents. 

   This method also accepts HTTP URI for remote files, however this feature is currently limited 
   to the Mac version, plan on enabling HTTP loading of SBML documents on Windows and Linux 
   shortly. 

   Some examples of loading files on Mac or Linux::
   
       >>> r.load("myfile.xml")                               # load a file from the current directory
       >>> r.load("/Users/Fred/myfile.xml")                   # absolute path
       >>> r.load("http://sbml.org/example_system.xml")       # remote file


   Or on Windows:

       >>> r.load("myfile.xml")                                  # load a file from the current directory
       >>> r.load("file://localhost/c:/Users/Fred/myfile.xml")   # using a URI

   One may also load the contents of a document::

       >>> myfile = open("myfile.xml, "r")
       >>> contents = file.read()
       >>> r.load(contents)
       
   Loading in a raw SBML string is also possible:

       >>> sbmlstr = rr.getCurrentSBML()         # Or any other properly formatted SBML string block
       >>> r.load(sbmlstr)

   In future version, we will also support loading directly from a libSBML Document object. 

   :param uriOrDocument: A string which may be a local path, URI or contents of an SBML document.

Simulation
----------

Fast and easy time series simulations is one of the main objectives of the RoadRunner project. 

All simulation related tasks can be accomplished with the single ``simulate`` method. 
 

.. method:: RoadRunner.simulate(*args, **kwargs)
   :module: RoadRunner



   Simulate and optionally plot current SBML model. This is the one stop shopping method
   for simulation and plotting. 

   simulate accepts a up to four positional arguments. 

   The first four (optional) arguments are treated as:
            
      1: Start Time, if this is a number. 

      2: End Time, if this is a number.

      3: Number of points, if this is a number.
            
      4: List of Selections. A list of variables to include in the output, e.g. ``['time','A']`` for a model with species ``A``. More below.

   All four of the positional arguments are optional. If any of the positional arguments are
   a list of string instead of a number, then they are interpreted as a list of selections. 
   
   There are a number of ways to call simulate.

   1: With no arguments. In this case, the current set of options from the previous 
      ``simulate`` call will be used. If this is the first time ``simulate`` is called, 
      then a default set of values is used. The default set of values are (start = 0, end = 5, points = 51).

   2: With up to four positions arguments, described above. 
   
   Finally, you can pass steps keyword argument instead of points. 
   
   steps (Optional) Number of steps at which the output is sampled where the samples are evenly spaced. Steps = points-1. Steps and points may not both be specified.

   :returns: a numpy array with each selected output time series being a
             column vector, and the 0'th column is the simulation time.
   :rtype: numpy.ndarray

   
.. method:: RoadRunner.gillespie(start, end, steps)
   :module: RoadRunner

   Use :meth:`RoadRunner.reset()` to reset the model each time.
   
   :param start: start time
   :param end: end time
   :param steps: number of steps
   :returns: a numpy array with each selected output time series being a
             column vector, and the 0'th column is the simulation time.
   :rtype: numpy.ndarray
   
   Examples:

   Simulate from time zero to 40 time units 
   
   >>> result = r.gillespie (0, 40)

   Simulate on a grid with 10 points from start 0 to end time 40 
   
   >>> result = r.gillespie (0, 40, 10)

   Simulate from time zero to 40 time units using the given selection list 
   
   >>> result = r.gillespie (0, 40, [‘time’, ‘S1’])

   Simulate from time zero to 40 time units, on a grid with 20 points using the given selection list 
   
   >>> result = r.gillespie (0, 40, 20, [‘time’, ‘S1’])
   

.. py:function:: RoadRunner.plot(result=None, loc='upper left', show=True)
   :module: RoadRunner
   
   Plot results from a simulation carried out by the simulate or gillespie functions. 
  
   To plot data currently held by roadrunner that was generated in the last simulation, use:

   If you are using Tellurium, see `tellurium.ExtendedRoadRunner.plot <https://tellurium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tellurium_methods.html#tellurium.tellurium.ExtendedRoadRunner.plot>`_ which supports extra arguements.
