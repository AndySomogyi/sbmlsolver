The Main RoadRunner Class
_________________________

.. class:: RoadRunner

   The main RoadRunner class. Its objects, i.e. ``rr = RoadRunner()`` perform 
   the libRoaRunner functions, i.e. ``rr.simulate()``.



.. method:: RoadRunner.__init__(uriOrSBML = "", options = None)

   Creates a new RoadRunner object. If the first argument is specified, 
   it should be a string containing either the contents of an SBML document, 
   or a formatted URI specifying the path or location of a SBML document. 

   If options is given, it should be a LoadSBMLOptions object. 

   If no arguments are given, a document may be loaded at any future time
   using the load method. 

   :param uriOrSBML: a URI, local path or SBML document contents.
   :type name: str (optional)

   :param options: (LoadSBMLOptions) an options object specifying how the 
                   SBML document should be loaded
   :type name: str (optional)


.. method:: RoadRunner.load(uriOrDocument)
   :module: RoadRunner

   Loads an SBML document, given a string for file path, URI, or contents. 

   This method also accepts HTTP URI for remote files, however this feature is currently limited 
   to the Mac version, plan on enabling HTTP loading of SBML documents on Windows and Linux 
   shortly. 

   Some examples of loading files on Mac or Linux::
   
       >>> r.load("myfile.xml")                               # load a file from the current directory
       >>> r.load("/Users/Fred/myfile.xml")                   # absolute path
       >>> r.load("http://sbml.org/example_system.xml")       # remote file


   Or on Windows:

       >>> r.load("myfile.xml")                                  # load a file from the current directory
       >>> r.load("file://localhost/c:/Users/Fred/myfile.xml")   # using a URI

   One may also load the contents of a document::

       >>> myfile = open("myfile.xml, "r")
       >>> contents = file.read()
       >>> r.load(contents)
       
   Loading in a raw SBML string is also possible:

       >>> sbmlstr = rr.getCurrentSBML()         # Or any other properly formatted SBML string block
       >>> r.load(sbmlstr)

   In future version, we will also support loading directly from a libSBML Document object. 

   :param uriOrDocument: A string which may be a local path, URI or contents of an SBML document. 
   :type name: str
   
   
.. method:: RoadRunner.saveState(document, option = 'b')
   :module: RoadRunner

   Saves the current state of the RoadRunner instance, e.g. integrator, steady state solver, simulation results,
   given a string for file path.
   If no option is given or the option is 'b', the state will be stored in a binary format which
   can be quickly reloaded for later simulation. This binary format is platform specific.
   It the option is 'r', the state will be stored in a human-readable format which can be used
   for debugging, but cannot be reloaded later.
   
   Some examples of saving binary files on Mac or Linux::
   
       >>> r.saveState("current_state.txt")                        # save the state to a file from the current directory
       >>> r.saveState("/Users/Fred/current_state.txt")            # absolute path


   Or on Windows:

       >>> r.saveState("current_state.txt")                        # save the state to a file from the current directory
       >>> r.saveState("file://localhost/c:/Users/Fred/current_state.txt")   # using a URI

   One may also save in a human-readable format:

       >>> r.saveState("current_state.txt", 'r')
       

   :param document: The file path where the current state will be stored
   :type name: str
   
   :param option:  an option object specifying how the state should be saved
   		   'b' - binary	(default)
		   'r' - human-readable 
   :type name: char(optional)
   
   
   
.. method:: RoadRunner.loadState(document)
   :module: RoadRunner

   Loads the saved state of a RoadRunner instance, e.g. integrator, steady state solver, simulation results,
   given a string for file path.
   All simulation calls after this function will start from the resumed state.
   
   Some examples of reloading binary files on Mac or Linux::
   
       >>> r.loadState("current_state.txt")                        # load the state from a file from the current directory
       >>> r.loadState("/Users/Fred/current_state.txt")            # absolute path


   Or on Windows:

       >>> r.loadState("current_state.txt")                        # load the state from a file from the current directory
       >>> r.loadState("file://localhost/c:/Users/Fred/current_state.txt")   # using a URI

   :param document: The file path where the state of simulation will be loaded from
   :type name: str

   :module: RoadRunner
   
   Add a species to the current model. Note that the species to be added must have an ID
   that did not existed in the model. The given compartment must also exist in the model.

   Add a rate rule for a variable to the current model.
   
   forceRegenerate is a boolean value that indicates whether the new model will be regenerated. Its 
   default value is true, which means to regenerate model every time after this function is called. 
   Note that regenerating model is time-consuming. To save time for editing model for multiple times, 
   one could set this flag to false excepting for the last call, so that Roadrunner will only regenerate 
   the model once after all editings are completed.
   
   For example,
   
   >>> r.addRateRule("s1", "k1", false) # it will not regenerate the model, nothing actually happened
   >>> r.addRateRule("s2", "k1", true)  # new model is generated and saved

Simulation
----------

Fast and easy time series simulations is one of the main objectives of the RoadRunner project. 

All simulation related tasks can be accomplished with the single ``simulate`` method. 
 

.. method:: RoadRunner.simulate(*args, **kwargs)
   :module: RoadRunner



   Simulate and optionally plot current SBML model. This is the one stop shopping method
   for simulation and plotting. 

   simulate accepts a up to four positional arguments. 

   The first four (optional) arguments are treated as:
            
      1: Start Time, if this is a number. 

      2: End Time, if this is a number.

      3: Number of points, if this is a number.
            
      4: List of Selections. A list of variables to include in the output, e.g. ``['time','A']`` for a model with species ``A``. More below.

   All four of the positional arguments are optional. If any of the positional arguments are
   a list of string instead of a number, then they are interpreted as a list of selections. 
   
   There are a number of ways to call simulate.

   1: With no arguments. In this case, the current set of options from the previous 
      ``simulate`` call will be used. If this is the first time ``simulate`` is called, 
      then a default set of values is used. The default set of values are (start = 0, end = 5, points = 51).

   2: With up to four positions arguments, described above. 
   
   Finally, you can pass steps keyword argument instead of points. 
   
   steps (Optional) Number of steps at which the output is sampled where the samples are evenly spaced. Steps = points-1. Steps and points may not both be specified.

   :returns: a numpy array with each selected output time series being a
             column vector, and the 0'th column is the simulation time.
   :rtype: numpy.ndarray

   
.. method:: RoadRunner.gillespie(start, end, steps)
   :module: RoadRunner
   
   Run a Gillespie stochastic simulation.
   
   Use :meth:`RoadRunner.reset()` to reset the model each time.
   
   :param start: start time
   :param end: end time
   :param steps: number of steps
   :returns: a numpy array with each selected output time series being a
             column vector, and the 0'th column is the simulation time.
   :rtype: numpy.ndarray
   
   Examples:

   Simulate from time zero to 40 time units 
   
   >>> result = r.gillespie (0, 40)

   Simulate on a grid with 10 points from start 0 to end time 40 
   
   >>> result = r.gillespie (0, 40, 10)

   Simulate from time zero to 40 time units using the given selection list 
   
   >>> result = r.gillespie (0, 40, [‘time’, ‘S1’])

   Simulate from time zero to 40 time units, on a grid with 20 points using the given selection list 
   
   >>> result = r.gillespie (0, 40, 20, [‘time’, ‘S1’])
   

.. py:function:: RoadRunner.plot(result=None, loc='upper left', show=True)
   :module: RoadRunner
   
   Plot results from a simulation carried out by the simulate or gillespie functions. 
  
   To plot data currently held by roadrunner that was generated in the last simulation, use:
   
   >>> r.plot() 
   
   If you are using Tellurium, see `tellurium.ExtendedRoadRunner.plot <https://tellurium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tellurium_methods.html#tellurium.tellurium.ExtendedRoadRunner.plot>`_ which supports extra arguements.
   
   :param numpy.ndarray result: Data returned from a simulate or gillespie call
   :param str loc: string representing the location of legend i.e. "upper right"


.. py:function:: Roadrunner.getSimulationData()
